  "9/7/24, 12:48 PM Metro releases new environmental study for Link Union Station | Urbanize LA\nGALLERY 4\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor a decade, Metro has been cooking up plans for a revamp of historic Union Station in\nDowntown Los Angeles (https://la.urbanize.city/tags/link-us), looking to couple long-proposed\nrun-through tracks with an expansion of its passenger concourse and new opportunities for\ncommercial development. With more than $1 trillion in funds available nationwide\n(https://la.urbanize.city/post/federal-infrastructure-bill-los-angeles)after President Biden signed\nthe landmark 2021 infrastructure bill into law, Metro is now taking steps to chase some of that\nfederal money.\nLast week, Metro released a supplemental environmental impact report for the Link Union Station\nproject (https://www.linkunionstation.com/), which will also evaluate the project under the\nNational Environmental Policy Act - making it eligible for federal funding. The highlights of the\nplans outlined in the document include the construction of new run-through tracks along the\nsouth side of the station, allowing trains to cross above the US-101 Freeway rather than entering\nhttps://la.urbanize.city/post/metro-releases-new-environmental-study-link-union-station 2/16",
  "9/7/24, 12:48 PM Metro releases new environmental study for Link Union Station | Urbanize LA\nand exiting through the existing throat tracks to the north. Plans also call for raising the rail yard\nitself to provide clearance above the freeway, the expansion of the existing passageway below the\nrail yard to accommodate more passengers, upgrades to the throat tracks, and either the\nconstruction of new individual station platform canopies or a large \"grand canopy\" which would\ncover all station platforms.\nThe project - in particular the construction of the run-through tracks - are key for the \u0000rst phase of\nthe California High Speed Rail project, which would make a stop at Union Station before\nproceeding toward its eventual southern terminus in Anaheim (https://la.urbanize.city/post/how-\ncalifornia-high-speed-rail-would-reach-anaheim). The new tracks would also be used by Amtrak\nPaci\u0000c Sur\u0000iner trains and Metrolink (https://la.urbanize.city/tags/metrolink), which is relying\non through-routing at Union Station as part of a $10-billion strategy to boost service frequency and\nridership on its more than 500-mile network.\nNot discussed in the new environmental study are potential changes to Link Union Station which\nwere unveiled earlier this year. While Metro has secured nearly $1 billion for the construction of\nthe project, its estimate cost has ballooned to nearly $2 billion as of one June 2023. To account for\nthat, Metro has proposed reducing the number of station platforms which would have access to\nthe run-through tracks from seven to four. Likewise, the number of run-through tracks crossing\nthe freeway could be reduced from four to two.\nSome early work, such as the relocation of utilities along the project's route, has already\ncommenced, and is expected to continue through Summer 2025. Metro previously announced that\nit expected that heavy construction could begin as early as mid-2026, following environmental\nclearances.\nPricey as it may be, the Biden administration has already shown a willingness to spend money on\nupgrading passenger rail serving the Los Angeles area. The Brightline West high-speed rail line,\nnow under construction between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga, has been awarded $6.5\nbillion from the U.S. Department of Transportation (https://la.urbanize.city/post/southern-\ncalifornia-vegas-high-speed-rail-line-gets-25b-more-federal-funding).\nFollow us on social media:\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/UrbanizeLA) / Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/urbanizela) /\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/urbanize-la) / Threads\n(https://www.threads.net/@urbanizela) / Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/urbanizela/)\nhttps://la.urbanize.city/post/metro-releases-new-environmental-study-link-union-station 3/16",

Something about other train stations with\ngrand canopies that seems timeless.\n11 0 Reply Share \u203a\nB BretMC \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nWhatever they do, will we \u0000nally get some development in that Northeast corner of Downtown \u0000nally? I've always\nthought maybe it's held up because of this project? it's sitting there so woefully underdeveloped/undeveloped and it\nwould be nice to see this get some major density \u0000nally instead of what's there. It's about as transit rich as things go\nin the city: you're adjacent to Union Station and the Little Tokyo station and a future station for the B & D lines!\n10 0 Reply Share \u203a\nMr. F \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago edited\nGlad to see this moving along, but curious about the compromises. A private train company like Brightline is\nawarded $6.5 billion from the U.S. Department of Transportation \u2014 so at what stage did Union Station believe it\nneeded to shrink its ambitions, and reduce the number of station platforms and run through tracks? Did they get a\nsense of a ceiling for those $1trillion in federal funds, or was this self-imposed? Can\u2019t help but wonder if this isn\u2019t just\nmore of our leadership\u2019s general lack of aspiration.\n6 0 Reply Share \u203a\nA ARoH > Mr. F \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nGood questions.\nI've noted before that it seemed like the this project made the full pass through option obsolete. The grade\nseparation just doesn't look tall enough to \u0000t the buses under for the eastern-most 2 or 3 tracks. So I\nassume the full version would be much more expensive than they expected due to their own short-\nsightedness...Seemedlikethetypicalprojectintegrationdisfunctionthey'resogoodat.\nhttps://la.urbanize.city/post/metro-releases-new-environmental-study-link-union-station 7/16",

The \"Build\" description is in Section 2.7.1. A table\nsummarizing which tracks will do what in the interim and complete project is in Table 2.5. It lists two run-through\ntracks initially for Amtrak/Metrolink and then adding 2 more at full build out for HSR. I think that it also lists $2.9\nbillion now as the cost for full buildout.\n4 0 Reply Share \u203a\nGranadico \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago edited\nAlmost looks like there's more cars in the Future than the Current when the hopeful reality would be the opposite and\nthere'd be less cars on the road.\n3 0 Reply Share \u203a\nA ARoH > Granadico \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nDid you say this backward?\n1 0 Reply Share \u203a\nN NIMBY Slayer: Textured Stucco\ud83e\udd2e > ARoH 2 months ago \u2212 \u2691\nOr maybe he just works for Chevron? \ud83d\ude02\n4 0 Reply Share \u203a\nGranadico > ARoH \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nDamn you're right.\n0 0 Reply Share \u203a\nA ARoH \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nWow.

Yeah- sums up LA's transit plight perfectly.\n5 0 Reply Share \u203a\nMatt > ARoH \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nJust the reality now. This was supposed to be a $1B project and now is almost 3 times\nthat. With a bankrupt federal, state and local government that is a huge problem. Word is\nMetro is starting to really panic as sales taxes are coming in much lower than projected\nwhile expenses are still rising fast. Something gotta give.\n2 1 Reply Share \u203a\nL LABergen > Matt \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nJust watched a video by RMTransit speaking about how the Olympics affect transit.\nAn interesting topic was how Vancouver\u2019s Olympics saw record numbers for their transit\nsystem, and post Olympic numbers have stayed higher than pre Olympic numbers ever\nsince, because it helped change the perception on transit for actual citizens.\nNot saying this will be replicated in LA, but the Olympics should be the greatest\nadvertisement opportunity for Metro in some time. Hopefully the new lines/ extensions\ncan be coupled with better service and safety. Add on a generation of more climate\nconscious citizens, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a chance that Olympics could have a similar affect like\nseen in Vancouver.\nMetro should be doing their absolute best strive for Olympic/ Post-Olympic greatness.\n7 0 Reply Share \u203a\nMatt > LABergen \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nIt sorta happened in 84. In fact, we have much lower transit usage now than we did in 84\nand 85 despite spending tens of billions on rail. Very sad, how we have let bus stops turn\ninto trash dumps and our Metro system become drug infested and violent. Until that\nchanges, we won't have a viable transit system.\n2 1 Reply Share \u203a\nA ARoH > Matt \u2212 \u2691\n2 months ago\nOur gov isn't bankrupt. What are you talking about? It's all made up.\nBut if it actually was... this would make the case for more centralized power- aka much a\nbigger government that has direct control of the resources it needs to build projects like\nthis, so \"costs\", in the monetary sense, aren't so much a consideration.\nMetro should be panicking- a lot of senior leadership should lose their jobs and their\nsiloed departments/projects should fold into each other. Cutting back on the scope of\nnecessary transit infrastructure is short-sighted and almost always screws us over in the\nlong run. They should be looking to minimize all their roadway commitments that they\ndon't need to improve mass transit.\n4 0 Reply Share \u203a\nP Paxton > ARoH \u2212 \u2691\nhttps://la.urbanize.city/post/metro-releases-new-environmental-study-link-union-station 9/16",
